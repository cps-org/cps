Sample CPS File
===============

The following presents a simple example of a ``.cps`` file.
This example includes a header-only CABI library,
a compiled CABI library with four configurations
(static/shared and debug/optimized),
an executable tool,
and a Java archive.
Many of the most commonly used attributes are demonstrated,
as is the technique discussed in `Configurations as Flags`_.
