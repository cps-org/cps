Package Schema
==============

Objects
'''''''

:object:`package`\ :hidden:`(object)`
-------------------------------------

The root of a CPS document is a |package| object.
A |package| object describes a single package.

:object:`platform`\ :hidden:`(object)`
--------------------------------------

A |platform| describes the platform
on which a package's components may run.

:object:`requirement`\ :hidden:`(object)`
-----------------------------------------

A |requirement| describes the specifics of a package dependency.

:object:`component`\ :hidden:`(object)`
---------------------------------------

A |component| is a consumable part of a package.
Typical components include libraries and executables.

:object:`configuration`\ :hidden:`(object)`
-------------------------------------------

A |configuration| holds attributes
that are specific to a particular configuration of a |component|.

Attributes
''''''''''

An optional attribute may have the value |null|.
This shall be equivalent to omitting the attribute.

Attribute names are case sensitive.

:attribute:`c_runtime_vendor`
-----------------------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |platform|
:Required: No

Specifies that the package's CABI components
require the specified C standard/runtime library.
Typical (case-insensitive) values include
:string:`"bsd"` (libc),
:string:`"gnu"` (glibc),
:string:`"mingw"` and
:string:`"microsoft"`.

:attribute:`c_runtime_version`
------------------------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |platform|
:Required: No

Specifies the minimum C standard/runtime library version
required by the package's CABI components.

:attribute:`clr_vendor`
-----------------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |platform|
:Required: No

Specifies that the package's CLR (.NET) components
require the specified `Common Language Runtime`_ vendor.
Typical (case-insensitive) values include
:string:`"microsoft"` and
:string:`"mono"`.

:attribute:`clr_version`
------------------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |platform|
:Required: No

Specifies the minimum `Common Language Runtime`_ version
required to use the package's CLR (.NET) components.

:attribute:`compat_version`
---------------------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |package|
:Required: No

Specifies the oldest version of the package
with which this version is compatible.
This information is used when a consumer requests a specific version.
If the version requested is equal to or newer
than the :attribute:`compat_version`,
the package may be used.

If not specified,
the package is not compatible with previous versions
(i.e. :attribute:`compat_version`
is implicitly equal to :attribute:`version`).

:attribute:`compile_features`
-----------------------------

:Type: |string-list|
:Applies To: |component|, |configuration|
:Required: No

Specifies a list of `Compiler Features`_
that must be enabled or disabled
when compiling code that consumes the component.

:attribute:`compile_flags`
--------------------------

:Type: |language-string-list|
:Applies To: |component|, |configuration|
:Required: No

Specifies a list of additional flags
that must be supplied to the compiler
when compiling code that consumes the component.
Note that compiler flags may not be portable;
use of this attribute is discouraged.

A map may be used instead to give different values
depending on the language of the consuming source file.
Handling of such shall be the same as for `definitions`_.

:attribute:`components` :applies-to:`(package)`
-----------------------------------------------

:Type: |map| to |component|
:Applies To: |package|
:Required: Yes

Specifies the components which the package provides.
Keys are the component names.

:attribute:`components` :applies-to:`(requirement)`
---------------------------------------------------

:Type: |string-list|
:Applies To: |requirement|
:Required: No

Specifies a list of components
which must be present in the required package
in order for the requirement to be satisfied.
Although the build tool will generally produce an error
if a consumer uses a component
which in turn requires a component that was not found,
early specification via this attribute
may help build tools to diagnose such issues earlier
and/or produce better diagnostics.

This may also be used to specify dependencies
that are not expressed in component level dependencies,
such as a package's requirement
that a dependency includes a certain symbolic component,
or if a dependency is only expressed at run-time.

:attribute:`configuration`
--------------------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |package|
:Required: Special

Specifies the name of the configuration
described by a configuration-specific ``.cps``
(see `Configuration Merging`_).
This attribute is required in a configuration-specific ``.cps``,
and shall be ignored otherwise.

:attribute:`configurations` :applies-to:`(package)`
---------------------------------------------------

:Type: |string-list|
:Applies To: |package|
:Required: No

Specifies the configurations that are preferred.
See `Package Configurations`_ for a description
of how configurations are used.

:attribute:`configurations` :applies-to:`(component)`
-----------------------------------------------------

:Type: |map| to |configuration|
:Applies To: |component|
:Required: No

Specifies a set of configuration-specific attributes for a |component|.
Keys are the configuration names.

:attribute:`cpp_runtime_vendor`
-------------------------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |platform|
:Required: No

Specifies that the package's CABI components
require the specified C++ standard/runtime library.
Typical (case-insensitive) values include
:string:`"gnu"` (libstdc++),
:string:`"llvm"` (libc++) and
:string:`"microsoft"`.

:attribute:`cpp_runtime_version`
--------------------------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |platform|
:Required: No

Specifies the minimum C++ standard/runtime library version
required by the package's CABI components.

:attribute:`cps_path`
---------------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |package|
:Required: No

Specifies the directory portion location of the ``.cps`` file.
This shall be an "absolute" path which starts with ``@prefix@``.
This provides an additional mechanism
by which the tool may deduce the package's prefix,
since the absolute location of the ``.cps`` file
will be known by the tool.
(See also `Prefix Determination`_.)

:attribute:`cps_version`
------------------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |package|
:Required: Yes

Specifies the version of the CPS
to which this ``.cps`` file conforms.
This may be used by tools to provide backwards compatibility
in case of compatibility-breaking changes in the CPS.

CPS version numbering follows |semver|_.
That is, tools that support CPS version ``<X>.<Y>``
are expected to be able to read files
with :attribute:`cps_version` ``<X>.<Z>``,
even for Z > Y
(with the understanding that, in such cases, the tool
may miss non-critical information that the CPS provided).

:attribute:`default_components`
-------------------------------

:Type: |string-list|
:Applies To: |package|
:Required: No

Specifies a list of components that should be inferred
if a consumer specifies a dependency on a package,
but not a specific component.

:attribute:`definitions`
------------------------

:Type: |language-string-list|
:Applies To: |component|, |configuration|
:Required: No

Specifies a list of compile definitions that must be defined
when compiling code that consumes the component.
Definitions should be in the form :string:`"FOO"` or :string:`"FOO=BAR"`.
Additionally, a definition in the form :string:`"!FOO"`
indicates that the specified symbol (``FOO``, in this example)
shall be explicitly undefined (e.g. ``-UFOO`` passed to the compiler).

A map may be used instead to give different values
depending on the language of the consuming source file.
In this case, the build tool shall select the list from the map
whose (case-sensitive) key matches the (lower case) language
of the source file being compiled.
Recognized languages shall include
:string:`"c"`,
:string:`"cpp"`, and
:string:`"fortran"`.

:attribute:`hints`
------------------

:Type: |string-list|
:Applies To: |requirement|
:Required: No

Specifies a list of paths
where a required dependency might be located.
When given, this will usually provide the location
of the dependency as it was consumed by the package
when the package was built,
so that consumers can easily find (correct) dependencies
if they are in a location that is not searched by default.

:attribute:`includes`
---------------------

:Type: |language-string-list|
:Applies To: |component|, |configuration|
:Required: No

Specifies a list of directories
which should be added to the include search path
when compiling code that consumes the component.
If a path starts with ``@prefix@``,
the package's install prefix is substituted
(see `Package Searching`_).
This is recommended, as it allows packages to be relocatable.

A map may be used instead to give different values
depending on the language of the consuming source file.
Handling of such shall be the same as for `definitions`_.

:attribute:`isa`
----------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |platform|
:Required: No

Specifies that the package's CABI components
require the specified `Instruction Set Architecture`_.
The value is case insensitive
and should follow the output of ``uname -m``.

:attribute:`jvm_vendor`
-----------------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |platform|
:Required: No

Specifies that the package's Java components
require the specified Java_ vendor.
Typical (case-insensitive) values include
:string:`"oracle"` and
:string:`"openjdk"`.

:attribute:`jvm_version`
------------------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |platform|
:Required: No

Specifies the minimum Java_ Virtual Machine version
required to use the package's Java components.

:attribute:`kernel`
-------------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |platform|
:Required: No

Specifies the name of the operating system kernel
required by the package's components.
The value is case insensitive
and should follow the output of ``uname -s``.
Typical values include
:string:`"windows"`,
:string:`"cygwin"`,
:string:`"linux"` and
:string:`"darwin"`.

:attribute:`kernel_version`
---------------------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |platform|
:Required: No

Specifies the minimum operating system kernel version
required by the package's components.

:attribute:`link_features`
--------------------------

:Type: |string-list|
:Applies To: |component|, |configuration|
:Required: No

Specifies a list of `Linker Features`_
that must be enabled or disabled
when linking code that consumes the component.

:attribute:`link_flags`
-----------------------

:Type: |string-list|
:Applies To: |component|, |configuration|
:Required: No

Specifies a list of additional flags
that must be supplied to the linker
when linking code that consumes the component.
Note that linker flags may not be portable;
use of this attribute is discouraged.

:attribute:`link_languages`
---------------------------

:Type: |string-list|
:Applies To: |component|, |configuration|
:Required: No

Specifies the ABI language or languages of a static library
(`type`_ :string:`"archive"`).
Officially supported (case-insensitive) values are
:string:`"c"` (no special handling required) and
:string:`"cpp"` (consuming the static library
also requires linking against the C++ standard runtime).
The default is :string:`"c"`.

:attribute:`link_libraries`
---------------------------

:Type: |string-list|
:Applies To: |component|, |configuration|
:Required: No

Specifies a list of additional libraries that must be linked against
when linking code that consumes the component.
(Note that packages should avoid using this attribute if at all possible.
Use `requires (component)`_ instead whenever possible.)

:attribute:`link_location`
--------------------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |component|, |configuration|
:Required: No

Specifies an alternate location of the component
that should be used when linking against the component.
This attribute typically applies only to :string:`"dylib"` components
on platforms where the library is separated into multiple file components.
For example, on Windows,
this attribute shall give the location of the ``.lib``,
while `location`_ shall give the location of the ``.dll``.

If the path starts with ``@prefix@``,
the package's install prefix is substituted
(see `Package Searching`_).
This is recommended, as it allows packages to be relocatable.

:attribute:`link_requires`
--------------------------

:Type: |string-list|
:Applies To: |component|, |configuration|
:Required: No

Specifies additional components required by a component
which are needed only at the link stage.
Unlike `requires (component)`_,
only the required components' link dependencies
should be applied transitively;
additional properties such as compile and include attributes
of the required component(s) should be ignored.

:attribute:`location`
---------------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |component|, |configuration|
:Required: Depends

Specifies the location of the component.
The exact meaning of this attribute
depends on the component type,
but typically it provides the path
to the component's primary artifact,
such as a ``.so`` or ``.jar``.
(For Windows DLL components,
this should be the location of the ``.dll``.
See also `link_location`_.)

If the path starts with ``@prefix@``,
the package's install prefix is substituted
(see `Package Searching`_).
This is recommended, as it allows packages to be relocatable.

This attribute is required for |component|\ s
that are not of :string:`"interface"` :attribute:`type`.

:attribute:`name`
-----------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |package|
:Required: Yes

Specifies the canonical name of the package.
In order for searching to succeed,
the name of the CPS file
without the ``.cps`` suffix
must exactly match (including case)
either :attribute:`name` as-is,
or :attribute:`name` converted to lower case.

:attribute:`platform`
---------------------

:Type: |platform|
:Applies To: |package|
:Required: No

Specifies the platform on which a package's components may run.
This allows tools to ignore packages
which target a different platform
than the platform that the consumer targets
(see `Package Searching`_).
Any platform attribute not specified
implies that the package's components
are agnostic to that platform attribute.
If this attribute is not specified,
the package is implied to be platform agnostic.
(This might be the case for a "library"
which consists entirely of C/C++ headers.
Note that JVM/CLR versions are platform attributes,
so packages consisting entirely of Java and/or CLR components
will still typically use this attribute.)

:attribute:`requires` :applies-to:`(component)`
-----------------------------------------------

:Type: |string-list|
:Applies To: |component|, |configuration|
:Required: No

Specifies additional components required by a component.
This is used, for example, to indicate transitive dependencies.
Relative component names are interpreted relative to the current package.
Absolute component names must refer to a package required by this package
(see `requires (package)`_).
Compile and link attributes should be applied transitively,
as if the consuming component also directly consumed the components
required by the component being consumed.

See also `link_requires`_.

:attribute:`requires` :applies-to:`(package)`
---------------------------------------------

:Type: |map| to |requirement|
:Applies To: |package|
:Required: No

Specifies additional packages that are required by this package.
Keys are the name of another required package.
Values are a valid |requirement| object or |null|
(equivalent to an empty |requirement| object)
describing the package required.

:attribute:`type`
-----------------

:Type: |string| (restricted)
:Applies To: |component|
:Required: Yes

Specifies the type of a component.
The component type affects how the component may be used.
Officially supported values are :string:`"executable"`
(any artifact which the target platform can directly execute),
:string:`"archive"` (CABI static library),
:string:`"dylib"` (CABI shared library),
:string:`"module"` (CABI plugin library),
:string:`"jar"` (Java Archive),
:string:`"interface"` and :string:`"symbolic"`.
If the type is not recognized by the parser,
the component shall be ignored.
(Parsers are permitted to support additional types
as a conforming extension.)

A :string:`"dylib"` is meant to be linked at compile time;
the :attribute:`location` specifies the artifact
required for such linking (i.e. the import library on PE platforms).
A :string:`"module"` is meant to be loaded at run time
with :code:`dlopen` or similar;
again, the :attribute:`location` specifies the appropriate artifact.

An :string:`"interface"` component is a special case;
it may have the usual attributes of a component,
but does not have a location.
This can be used to create "virtual" components
that do not have an associated artifact.

A :string:`"symbolic"` component is even more special,
as it has no (required) attributes at all,
and the meaning of any attributes or configurations
assigned to such a component is unspecified.
A :string:`"symbolic"` component is intended
to be used as a form of feature testing;
a package that has a feature that is meaningful to users
but does not otherwise map directly to a component
may use a symbolic component
to indicate availability of the feature to users.

:attribute:`version` :applies-to:`(package)`
--------------------------------------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |package|
:Required: No

Specifies the version of the package.
The format of this string is determined by `version_schema`_.

If not provided, the CPS will not satisfy any request
for a specific version of the package.

:attribute:`version` :applies-to:`(requirement)`
------------------------------------------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |requirement|
:Required: No

Specifies the required version of a package.
If omitted, any version of the required package is acceptable.
Semantics are the same
as for the :attribute:`version` attribute of a |package|.

:attribute:`version_schema`
---------------------------

:Type: |string|
:Applies To: |package|
:Required: No

Specifies the structure
to which the package's version numbering conforms.
Tools may use this to determine how to perform version comparisons.
Officially supported (case-insensitive) values are
:string:`"simple"` and :string:`"custom"`
(:string:`"rpm"` or :string:`"dpkg"` should be used where applicable,
but may not be supported by all tools).
If a package uses :string:`"custom"`,
version numbers may be compared,
but version ordering is not possible.
The default is :string:`"simple"`.

Needless to say,
changing a package's version scheme between releases
is *very strongly discouraged*.

Note that this attribute determines
only how version numbers are *ordered*.
It does not imply anything
about the compatibility or incompatibility
of various versions of a package.
See also `compat_version`_.

- :string:`simple`

  The package's version number
  shall match the regular expression
  ``[0-9]+([.][0-9]+)*([-+].*)?``.

  The portion of the version
  which precedes the optional ``-`` or ``+``
  may be interpreted as a tuple of integers,
  in which leading zeros are ignored.
  Version numbers are compared according to numerical order,
  starting from the first (left-most) number of the tuples.
  If two version numbers have different tuple sizes,
  the shorter tuple shall be implicitly filled with zeros.

.. deprecated:: 0.9.0

    :string:`"semver"` is a deprecated alias for :string:`"simple"`.

Notes
'''''

- Unless otherwise specified,
  a relative file path appearing in a CPS
  shall be interpreted relative to the ``.cps`` file.

- Unless otherwise specified,
  unrecognized attributes shall be ignored.
  This makes it easier for tools to add tool-specific extensions.
  (It is *strongly* recommended that the names of any such attributes
  start with ``x_<tool>_``, where ``<tool>`` is the (lower case) name
  of the tool which introduced the extension,
  in order to reduce the chance of conflicts
  with newer versions of the CPS.)

- The term "CABI", as used throughout,
  refers to (typically C/C++/Fortran) code
  compiled to the machine's native instruction set
  and using the platform's usual format for such binaries
  (ELF, PE32, etc.).
