This document describes the schema
for Common Package Specification files.
A Common Package Specification file
(hereafter "CPS")
is a mechanism for describing
how users may consume a package.
"User" here refers to another package,
not an end user.
CPS deals with *building* software,
not *installing* software.

CPS is based on `JSON`_.
A CPS file is a valid JSON object.

The official version of the specification
is maintained at https://github.com/cps-org/cps.
